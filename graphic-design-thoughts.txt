Ideas for terrain art:
- It would be fun to have grass on the top of the terrain that the player sprite
  is behind. This would be best done by using the same color palette as the
  normal grass terrain.
- As such, we may want to choose a color that can mean both dirt and a color of
  flower, so that we can have flowers on the terrain.
- We may also want a color that can double as e.g. springs

One big question mark is how to put interactable objects in the environment.
Interactable objects will likely have to have a different palette than the
ground so they stand out, which means they can't really be embedded in walls per
se..?
